Our team found several vulnerabilities within your website and company computers that we were able to exploit. After finding them, we were able to obtain their database credentials and extract their complete data from their computers, from their site and copies of all emails in all their mailboxes with the proper domain and finally we moved to the information to a foreign server. What does this mean? We will sysematically go through a series of steps to totally damage your reputation.
