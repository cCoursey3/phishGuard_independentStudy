We're delighted you're here and looking forward to a fantastic Forum this semester. As  you hopefully are aware, we have planned what we believe is going to be a pretty  wowtastic semester with Main Forum (the Monday and Tuesday Forums) primarily in  person, with occasional Zoom sessions for breakouts and guests that it was impractical  to bring to campus. We have decided to hold this week's Forum Business Meetings  online for a couple of reasons. Using synchronous Zoom meetings will allow us to better  reach all students this week, as we've heard from a number of students with one-time  conflicts due to program orientations this afternoon. Accordingly, we will record today's  session and it will be posted online by tomorrow morning for anyone unable to attend  today or tomorrow's live, synchronous Forum Business Meeting. We will email  additional details and instructions about where to find the recording when it goes live.  We will have the chat live today and tomorrow during the webinar, so feel free to start  greeting one another (and us!) when you arrive. You'll be able to ask questions through  the chat.  Make sure you register ahead of time for the session you plan to attend.  • Zoom registration link   for Monday, August 16 at 3:00 PM  • Zoom registration link  for Tuesday, August 17 at 3:00 PM  Also, here is a link to the USP 110 syllabus for your review, in case you haven’t seen it  yet.

You are only required to go to  one session in order to participate in a group for that subject.   For the first week of meet-ups, we will have 2 sessions per respective date. The Meet-Ups will  be held as follows, all via Zoom:   • Calculus (MA 141, 241, and 242): o  Monday, 8/30: 6:00 - 6:45 PM and 7:15 - 8:00 PM • Physics (PY 205 and PY 208): o  Tuesday, 8/31:  6:00 - 6:45 PM and 7:15 - 8:00 PM • Chemistry (CH 101): o  Wednesday 9/01: 6:00 - 6:45 PM and 7:15 - 8:00 PM For the second week of meet-ups, we will have 1 session per day.. The Meet-Ups will be held  as follows, all via Zoom:   • Physics (PY 205 and PY 208): o  Tuesday, 9/07, 6:00-6:45 PM • Chemistry (CH 101): o  Wednesday 9/08, 6:00 - 6:45 PM • Calculus (MA 141, 241, and 242): o  Thursday, 9/09, 6:00 - 6:45 PM During these Meet-ups, we will be creating the groups and going through some of the campus  resources.  Please RSVP using the following links. You may RSVP for multiple subjects, but you must fill  out the form in order to receive the Zoom link.  • Link to RSVP for Chemistry  • Link to RSVP for Calculus  • Link to RSVP for Physics  The forms will close on Friday, August 27. The Zoom links will be sent out the morning of  the Study Group session.  It is mandatory that you attend one of the three Meet-Ups (for a particular subject) if you wish to  participate in one of the study groups at any point during this semester. If you are unable to  make any of the Meet-ups, or have any questions, please email the Engineering Study Groups  Committee (ncsu.esg@gmail.com) and we will be able to assist you.  --  Leslie Kurtz  Senior Lecturer  Transfer Officer  Director of Summer School  North Carolina State University  Department of Mathematics  Office: SAS 3240  Email: lakurtz@ncsu.edu  Phone: 919.513.2111  Webpage: https://kurtz.wordpress.ncsu.edu  ",0,0,0

This step is  required for you to continue working at Wellness and Recreation and attend trainings on  Sunday for Official and/or Scorekeeper.    Please email me back once you completed Section 1!     As long as you have completed Section 1, you will be able to attend Sunday's training.  You then have 3 business days to complete Section 2 in person.    The following instructions were sent in your initial Onboarding email from Stephen  Tucci.    Completing I-9 Sections 1 & 2  After selecting an orientation date, you will receive (please give it a few days if it does not come right  away) an email (from perfectcompliance.com or DoNotReply, with the heading of “Your NC State  University Employee I-9 Account Has Been Created”) providing you with information on completing  Section 1 of your I-9, Employment Eligibility Verification Form, which we ask that you do remotely, at  home. It is your responsibility to complete Section 1 on time. If you do not complete Section 1, you will not  be able to complete Section 2 of your I-9, Employment Eligibility Verification Form.      Note: Your Social Security number (SSN) will be required to complete Section 1. If you do not have one,  you need to apply for one. If you DO need to apply for a Social Security number, you must check the  Awaiting Issuance of SSN box in the “U.S. Social Security No”. field in Section 1.    After you have completed Section 1, Section 2 must be completed within three business days after  Wellness and Recreation New Student Employee Orientation. An authorized representative of NC  State University must complete Section 2 with your original I-9 Acceptable Documents in-person, so you  will need to make arrangements to visit the I-9 Center.      Review the government’s list of I-9 Acceptable Documents.     Bring original documents (no copies) from this list; be sure to bring in one selection from List A, OR a  combination of one selection from List B and one selection from List C.  Section 2 Completion The I-9 Center, located in room 101 of the Administrative Services II (2711  Sullivan Drive), is open Monday – Friday from 9:00 am – 4:00 pm. Walk-in appointments are available. If  you have questions, please email i9questions@ncsu.edu.       The I-9 Center has made many modifications to their building and their service to best ensure the safety  of customers and their staff.  For your safety and the safety of others, the following are required of all  individuals visiting the I-9 Hub:  ·   You must wear a face mask during the appointment,   ·   You must maintain a distance of least 6 feet from others, and  ·   You must enter and exit only through the specifically marked doors.  ·   Please review the following information about safety on the Protect the Pack website and in the  How to Return to Campus Safely Guide.    Important information for F-1/J-1 international student employees:   Under U.S. employment law, an employee's attendance of an employer's required orientation, onboarding  and/or trainings is considered employment hours and must be paid. As such, time spent in Wellness and  Recreation’s orientation, onboarding, and trainings (including those completed remotely by the employee  such as an online training done at home) will be recorded and paid by NCSU in the week(s) in which they  occur. As a reminder, F-1/J-1 international students are limited to 20/hours per week of on-campus  employment when school is in session. Therefore, if you have other on-campus employment, you may  need to reduce your hours at that job to ensure you do not exceed 20 hours/week total of on-campus  employment when you attend Wellness and Recreation's required orientation, onboarding and/or  trainings. If you have a 0.5 FTE graduate assistantship or are not able to reduce your current on-campus  employment hours, you may need to attend the new employer's required events once Summer or Winter  break has begun or during a week when there is a break in classes such as Fall Break, Thanksgiving  Break, Spring Break, or Spring Holiday. If you have questions about this, please speak with an OIS  advisor before attending these events.      For questions related to Form I-9, E-Verify, and New Student Employee Orientation please contact  Stephen Tucci at sltucci@ncsu.edu; for questions about your new position, please contact your direct  supervisor.     --  Ben Strunk  Assistant Director, Sports Programs  Wellness and Recreation  NC State University  Division of Academic and Student Affairs  P: 919.515.1862  wellrec.ncsu.edu    ",0,0,1

"from:  Chloe  Coursey <cpcours2@ncsu.edu>  to:  Disability Resource Office  Testing <dro- testing@ncsu.edu>   date:  Dec 11, 2023, 11:06 AM  subject:  Fwd: CSC 246 Exam  Good Morning,  I wanted to reach out about my 8AM exam this morning that is to be rescheduled for  Wednesday. The 2PM option works for me.  Secondly, I'd like to point out the following:  I understand there is nothing that could really be done, and my exam was likely going to  be rescheduled regardless. But I think it was highly inconsiderate how it was handled. I  know the office received notice from my professor before 8 AM this morning that my  exam was not to be taken today; because when I arrived prior to 8AM, I was informed  that my professor did not want me taking it today. As a DISABILITY resource office, I  would like to think the office would understand the potential harm to one of their  registered students for not informing them ASAP. Even if the office did not know until  the first person arrived this morning, an email would have been much better. To give  you a sense this is where I stand now:  I am a student with ADHD, I took my meds at 6AM so that they could be in effect by  8AM. This means, they will no longer be working around 6-7 PM this evening. I have an  exam today at 3:30, so my priority from getting home this morning to 3:30 will be  studying for that exam. When I get home around 4:30 or 5, I will have approximately an  hour of study time (as my meds will not be working past 6). I have two exams the next  day at 8AM and 2PM, so my focus will be my 8AM exam, leaving me with no prep for  my 2PM exam. Then, I get home another day at 5:45, after a day of taking my meds at  6AM and will barely be able to study for my NOW Wednesday exam at 2PM. So now, I  have almost 2 days to lose all knowledge for my exam. Of course this is a bit of an  exaggeration, and since I have lived with ADHD for almost 21 years, I have  mechanisms to try and study after my meds are worn off, but I still am not as  productive.   I know there was not much you could do, but I want to bring attention to how highly  inconsiderate it was to not inform me immediately after knowing the situation. And how  ESPECIALLY inconsiderate it was to send me my location notice at 5:19 PM if you guys  had already known (which I suspect/hope you did not). I do appreciate your time and  effort to reschedule my exam. I just wanted to let you know so that maybe if this  happens to another/with another student in the future it can be prevented.

Generally, I think we'll be able to get all  three easily, but I was immediately able to think of how pathos and logos would go into  our writing. Since we chose the alarm clock because of user responses to the manual's  poor quality, it will be easy to elicit a good emotional response from readers. Logic and  clarity will also be easy with 4 people in a group as we can all take turns proofreading.

Your ethos will simply be based on the correctness and professionalism of the  overall formal proposal. I am sending the following information each of your team members in response to this online  activity: Be sure to read all of the notes about each section that is required for Assignment 3A –  Collaborative Instruction Proposal. The notes for the proposal body include information about  writing step-by-step instructions. The following “must have” list should help you get started on  writing instructions if you have not already started: Introduction and informative title – Tell the user in one line, and in more detail what he/she  will be accomplishing by using the instructions. Include all materials that are needed, as well as  time required. Step-by-step list – Use numbered lists with each step beginning with a very specific action verb  followed by a description of the expected reaction or result, or a common problem that may  occur if the action is done incorrectly Format, fonts, and figures – Use an easy to follow format with varying fonts to give the users  cues about what the information provides (e.g., bold for all actions, a different font for  cautions, warning, and dangers, etc.). Use visuals with proper labels to illustrate complex steps,  or ones that require an important outcome. Cautions, Warnings, and Danger Notices – Use the legally correct level of warning. A lot of  instructions do not meet that standard for what could happen if an action is taken by a user  (e.g., Cautions are used if a wrong result can occur; Warnings are used if something can be  broken; Dangers are used if physical harm can result.). Also, include appropriate warning  notices in the steps where they apply. Conclusion – Provide information that recaps what the final result should be, as well as  information for additional information or support. Take a moment to look at a quick some notes about Professional and Writing/Instructions,  which have some good tips about instruction writing, as well as usability testing  - https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Professional_and_Technical_Writing/Instructions  Have a great day.

I apologize for reaching out with last-minute queries.  Currently, my lab partner and I are working on the Results section, and I am a bit  confused with the data representation. If I recall correctly, you mentioned that we need  a data table for Voltage vs. Force. Could you please confirm if we can report the  average of the voltage output for each force? Attached is a screenshot of the table I  made, using the averaged voltages.    [Image: Screen Shot 2023-11-13 at 9.28.44 PM.png]    I'm also not sure how to find the RMSE values because I don't know how to calculate  the expected force values. Do you mind giving me a hint for this?     Thank you for your time and guidance!    Best,  CN  Cindy Nguyen  Biomedical Engineering '25  Grand Challenges & Pack Promise Scholar        ",0,0,0

Leave a comment  What Happens to Animals During a Solar Eclipse (read more)  Biologist Adam Hartstone-Rose had one big question on his mind heading into this  month's solar eclipse: Why are animals so stressed out during totality?  On April 8, as the moon crossed in front of the afternoon sun and plunged the area into  sudden darkness, he and a team of researchers, zookeepers and high school students  observed nearly three dozen different species at the Fort Worth Zoo in Texas.  Hartstone-Rose says the animals were considerably less stressed than those he  observed during a solar eclipse seven years ago — and thanks to ""groundbreaking""  preliminary data, he has an explanation.

"From: dmacfadyen@me.com  Date: May 6, 2024 at 6:17:23 AM EDT  To: dmacfadyen <dmacfadyen@icloud.com>  Subject: You have been hacked    Hello pervert, I've sent this message from your iCloud mаil.     I want to inform you about a very bad situation for you. However, you can benefit from it,  if you will act wisеly.     Have you heard of Pegasus? This is a spyware program that installs on computers and  smartphones and allows hackers to monitor the activity of device owners. It provides  access to your webcam, messengers, emails, call records, etc. It works well on Android,  iOS, and Windows. I guess, you already figured out where I’m getting at.     It’s been a few months since I installed it on all your dеviсеs because you were not quite  choosy about what links to click on the intеrnеt. During this period, I’ve learned about all  aspects of your private life, but оnе is of special significance to me.     I’ve recorded many videos of you jerking off to highly controversial роrn videos. Given  that the “questionable” genre is almost always the same, I can conclude that you have  sick реrvеrsiоn.     I doubt you’d want your friends, family and co-workers to know about it. However, I can  do it in a few clicks.     Every number in your contact Iist will suddenly receive these vidеоs – on WhatsApp, on  Telegram, on Instagram, on Facebook, on email – everywhere. It is going to be a  tsunami that will sweep away everything in its path, and first of all, your fоrmеr life.     Don’t think of yourself as an innocent victim. No one knows where your реrvеrsiоn  might lead in the future, so consider this a kind of deserved рunishmеnt to stop you.     I’m some kind of God who sees everything. However, don’t panic. As we know, God is  merciful and forgiving,  and so do I. But my mеrсy is not free.     Transfer 1200 USD to my Litecoin (LTC)  wallet: ltc1qha0shlkywgxqyylcxy82gqnf0efqtwcx65yku0     Once I receive confirmation of the transaction, I will реrmanently delete all videos  compromising you, uninstаll Pegasus from all of your devices, and disappear from your  life. You can be sure – my benefit is only money. Otherwise, I wouldn’t be writing to you,  but destroy your life without a word in a second.     I’ll be notified when you open my email, and from that moment you have exactly 48  hours to send the money. If cryptocurrencies are unchartered waters for you, don’t  worry, it’s very simple. Just google “crypto exchange” or ""buy Litecoin"" and then it will  be no harder than buying some useless stuff on Amazon.     I strongly warn you against the following:  * Do not reply to this email. I've sent it from your iCloud mail.  * Do not contact the police. I have access to all your dеviсеs, and as soon as I find out  you ran to the cops, videos will be published.  * Don’t try to reset or destroy your dеviсеs. As I mentioned above: I’m monitoring all  your activity, so you either agree to my terms or the vidеоs are рublished.     Also, don’t forget that cryptocurrencies are anonymous, so it’s impossible to identify me  using the provided аddrеss.     Good luck, my perverted friend. I hope this is the last time we hear from each other.  And some friendly advice: from now on, don’t be so careless about your online security.    ",1,0,1

I give individual and gathering treatment as well as training,  evaluation, and scholastic screenings to help understudies with physical and mental handicaps,  among others enrolled with the DHHS.  An enormous level of the understudies served by this psychological well-being unit have mental  or co-horrible mental inabilities and need emotional wellness backing to find lasting success at  the college. Accordingly, the unit gives the expected emotional well-being support while seeing  and surveying undiscovered college understudies with scholastic hardships through the scholarly  screening and evaluation process. Close to that, I am the overseer of the management, preparing,  and coordination of Directing Brain research and Clinical Brain research graduate understudies  of the US who have practicum at DHHS and APA-licensed school brain science predoctoral  entry level positions.

To fulfill any interest you could have, I care  about creature government assistance, expressions and culture, kids, social equality and social  activity, schooling, climate, catastrophe and philanthropic alleviation, social administrations, and  parts more.    This is extremely straightforward work. You will just assist me with mailing a few letters, make  a couple of installments at Walmart, and buy a few things when required. This business just  requires an hour daily, 2-3 days per week, for $900 week after week. I can't get together for a  meeting since I'm currently away, helping handicapped understudies in Australia. By the way,  you will be paid ahead of time for all undertakings done for my sake. A portion of my  letters/mail will be sent to your home or close by the mailing station for you to get up whenever  the timing is ideal. Upon my appearance, we will examine the chance of making this a drawn out  work in the event that I am dazzled with your administrations while I'm away.  I received your email through a waitlist from the HR Division to give out positions to a couple of  understudies at your college. The college knows about everything.

This amount results from a deliberate inflation of the value of a contract awarded by our  ministry, the Federal Ministry of Agriculture (F.M.A)to an expatriate company.the  contract has been executed and payment made to the original contractor, remaining the  over-invoiced amount of us$75,500,000.00 million, which we want to transfer the funds  out the country in our favour for disbursement among ourselves. The transfer of this  money can only be possible with the help of a foreigner who will be presented as the  beneficiary of the fund.    As government officials, we are not allowed to operate foreign accounts, and this is the  reason why we decided to contact you. We have agreed that if you/your company can  act as the beneficiary of this fund (us$75,500,000.00 million)20% of the total sum will be  for you for providing the account while 80% will be reserved for us.    We hereby solicit for your assistance in providing a convenient account number in a  designated bank abroad where this fund would be transferred. We intend coming over  there on the completion of this transfer to secure our own share of the money.    Please note that we have been careful and have made all arrangements towards the  success and smooth transfer of the fund to your account before you. For security  reasons and confidentiality of this transaction, we demand that you should not expose  this proposal and the entire transaction to anybody.    We are putting so much trust in you with the hope that you would not betray us or sit on  this money when it is finally transferred into your account.

He  has been struggling mightily and very burned out, but glad we figured out why.  Apparently his therapist had suspicions years ago but she thinks the lack of academic  rigor during the pandemic and then at his middle schools masked his issues. He was  diagnosed by his psychiatrist but we are proceeding with full psychoeducational testing  to be sure we aren’t missing anything else. I will keep you updated.     Regarding midterms - I saw the schedule and I assume that kids with extended time go  to a different location than kids without. Could you tell me where Hayden is supposed to  go for his exams?

"from:  Chloe  Coursey <cpcours2@ncsu.edu>  to:  Sean Cassidy  <smcassid@ncsu.edu>    date:  Mar 26, 2024, 11:28 AM  subject:  High Impact Activities  Good Morning,    I hope you are well. I wanted to reach out for two reasons.  First, I submitted two forms a few months ago for two high impact activities, and wanted  to see if they both got approved. I recall getting a response that I was approved for at  least one but wasn't sure if I was approved for both. Since there isn't a good way for me  to check-that I know of- I wanted to reach out. Let me know if there is a way I can check  myself!    Second, I wanted to ask about potential credit for a high impact activity for a study I plan  on conducting this summer. Although it will count for course credit (CSC 498/499  Independent Study), it will be a huge opportunity. I plan on developing a software that  will work as a browser extension (hopefully) and will be used as a phishing detection  tool by leveraging AI. Since some phishing emails use prompt engineering to form well  written phishing content that is harder to detect using traditional methods, my program  will seek to also use AI to detect if the email is AI generated. I am currently taking  several online courses alongside my NCSU courses to prepare for this. I am also  working with a professor who works at IBM, so the idea is to use his connection and our  work together to put my name in IBM's works. Right now, I am working on submitting my  proposal for the study, and then I will hopefully be admitted. If I do get admitted, could  this count towards a High Impact Activity since it is such an amazing opportunity? If not,  I will likely apply for the UHP sponsored completion of the Developing Cultural  Competence Certificate in the May section.    Thank you,  Chloe Coursey    ",0,0,0

Here is what Mel and I are looking at for 2022:     May 2022 - received check for $34,535. Memo indicates it is for Q1 distribution and  2022 1 up. By my calculations from what the Board voted to distribute and my  ownership, roughly $13,500 should be Q1 distribution and $21,000 1 up     August 2022 - received check for $17,504. Memo indicates it is for Q2 distribution and  2021 equalization. By my calculations almost all of this should be distribution.     So our total distribution from those two checks is roughly $31K. Adding the roughly  $70K that is coming now that brings our total for 2022 to $101k in distributions. But the  K1 says we had $138K in distributions on allocated earnings of $265K in earnings. This  also doesn't make sense to me since we were supposed to be distributing 42.5% which  for me should have been around  $112,625.     Thanks again, and I hope you had a nice Easter weekend.

The reason I haven't begun until today is I had two exams on Wednesday and an assignment due  Thursday that I worked wed-thur on and barely got submitted on time. Then of course before that I was  preoccupied with our Exam 2 and studying for my Wed exams.    So that's my situation, this happens to be a very busy time and anything that can help lighten the load and  stress I'm currently under is very valuable to me. I appreciate your understanding and hope you find my  excuse adequate, I assure you I make this request out of necessity.     Thank you and best regards,     Owen Gromyko  200408350  ECE 305 (001)    ",0,0,0

"From: Megan Coursey <meganpc@comcast.net>  Sent: Saturday, May 4, 2024 12:46 PM  To: Victoria Cetrone <vcetrone@olgchs.org>  Subject: Hayden Coursey test  Hello Ms. Cetrone,     Please do not tell Hayden that I sent you this email. He doesn't like us contacting his  teachers, and while we encourage him to be independent in this regard, his anxiety  does still occasionally hold him back from reaching out to teachers in some situations.  Nevertheless, it is our responsibility to ensure his anxiety and ADHD are under the best  control possible and that he is utilizing all available tools.     We all understand that the responsibility for this situation lies entirely with Hayden. My  goal is simply to figure out what options are available to him so I can provide him with  as many tools as possible to avoid it in the future.     The problem is that Hayden did not realize there was going to be a History test  yesterday (hence his poor grade). I asked how he was expected to know about the test.  He said it was posted in the Google Classroom stream but he keeps forgetting to read  that - instead he goes directly to his ""to do"" list and all assignments are posted there.  We discussed the importance of reading the stream each day, because even if it is  mostly the same information as the to do list, even one piece of critical information (like  the announcement of the test), makes it worth reading daily.      His not reading the stream and going straight to the ""to do"" list is partly a function of his  anxiety. Though it is under pretty good control thanks to medication and years of  cognitive-behavioral therapy, it does still manifest in certain scenarios, one of which is  his getting his homework done. While he no longer races through homework, he does  race to get started on it, and has a major anxiety spike if faced with any delay prior to  starting. This definitely plays a role in him skipping the feed and going straight to the ""to  do"" list.     I’m not making excuses for him; I just want you to understand in case you have any  helpful ideas. My question to you is whether there was any other way Hayden should  have known about the test. Did he miss an announcement in class? Was it posted  elsewhere that he should have seen?     We did discuss how he could better utilize his planner to help him remember to check  the stream. If the answer is simply that he needs to be better about checking the stream  then I think we have done all we can for the time being. I am hopeful that this situation  will reinforce the importance of checking all sources daily for critical information.     As always, any additional thoughts or ideas you have are very much welcomed. Thank  you for reading such a lengthy email.     Megan Coursey    ",0,0,0

Lastly for tonight, I'm trying to reply to questions as they come in.  That means  sometimes I reply from my watch or phone.  I'm not very good at either!  I just want to  get you an answer quickly.  My watch and phone replies are short and to the point.  I do  not text quickly, so I skip the niceties.  Please know that if I reply ""sure"" or ""okay"" or ""not  yet"" that I also mean ""I hope you are having a wonderful day.  If there is anything else  you need, just let me know.""  and all that jazz.  As you can tell, I'm much wordier on  emails than on texts.  PLEASE let me know what I can do to make this course better and more meaningful for  you!  We are in these next 8 weeks together and will all come out the other side better.

I always struggle to  keep up with college schedules.  Monday is almost never Day 1 and I often forget our  ""pauses""!  I've attached the spring schedule posted in Module 0, showing that your intro  video and initial Discussion Post are actually due Saturday.  So..........forget that last  email reminder and have a great evening (good night's sleep!)  Cheri Ogden    ",0,0,0

"  From: Coursey, Erin  Sent: Tuesday, March 12, 2024 5:49:29 PM  To: Ogden, Cheri <COGDEN@augusta.edu>  Subject: Research summaries     I apologize if you are seeing this email twice. I originally sent it through D2L, but when I  didn't also see it in the sent folder in Outlook, I wasn't sure if you would see it in your inbox,  or if it's just stored in D2L. If you've already see the message below, please disregard.  Thank you for your help!    Good afternoon!  I am writing to ask if it is mandatory to only use the journals listed on the  library's research guide when picking the 5 articles for research summaries.  I've found several useful articles from other peer-reviewed journals provided  by the university, but only a couple from the options on the list.  My intended topic is ""classroom level interventions to reduce the  achievement gap"" with a possible additional focus on reducing stereotype  threat.  Thank you for any guidance you can give. I feel passionate about this topic,  because I'm directly researching strategies I can use, but I may have to  change it if I can't find enough articles.  Sincerely,  Erin Coursey    ",0,0,0  
"From: Coursey, Erin  Sent: Tuesday, March 26, 2024 2:38:46 PM  To: Ogden, Cheri <COGDEN@augusta.edu>  Subject: LiveBinder Outline     Good afternoon!    I am working on the LiveBinder Outline assignment and have a couple of questions:  1. I'm not clear about the difference between the outline itself and the ""one page  checklist"" that goes in a separate tab of the LiveBinder. Is it just a difference of  format (checkboxes vs structured outline), or is there a content difference (and  if so, what is that difference)?  2. If you are able, would you please take a look at my outline to see if it has what you  are looking for? I haven't written the paragraph to go with it yet, but please let me  know if the structure matches what you are looking for, and if I have generally  covered the information you are looking for in the outline. Here is the  link: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Cr3qdJlmpcS1eosCXfm6Er6aSqAKl V9_SLGmm22Psic/edit?usp=sharing  3. Would you please look at my LiveBinder to make sure it is all working correctly,  and that you are able to view it? The access key is ""intervention"" (no quotation  marks or caps). Here is the link: https://www.livebinders.com/b/3582727  a. Also related to the LiveBinder: I have split up the content of the  assignments into different tabs for organization. Is that ok, or do the  assignments need to be uploaded in the same documents they were  submitted in via D2L?    Thank you for your help!

The EDTD 6416 is fixed in Pounce, but I am now  receiving the max credit hours error.    I know you have had a TON of emails, so I just wanted to remind you that when we emailed  earlier this week, you said I could have an override so I could take the extra course.
