Welcome to the 2023 Season of Marching here at GC! Next week is our alumni game, and you are invited to come see what we are up to! If you would like, you are more than welcome to perform with the ensemble during pre-game, but you are also welcome to just hang out with us in the stands, and get a sense of how we have grown over the years! Our Dress Rehearsal starts at 3:45 pm for those who would like to attend, and we still eat dinner as an ensemble at 4:45! Pre-Game kicks off at 6:45, with a 7:00 game!         I sincerely hope you consider joining us this year, we have a fantastic group of kids who have put together a great show! HERE is the link to register for this FREE event, I hope to see you there
