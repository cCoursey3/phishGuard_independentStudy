I hope you had a great weekend. I apologize for reaching out with last-minute queries. Currently, my lab partner and I are working on the Results section, and I am a bit confused with the data representation. If I recall correctly, you mentioned that we need a data table for Voltage vs. Force. Could you please confirm if we can report the average of the voltage output for each force? Attached is a screenshot of the table I made, using the averaged voltages.I'm also not sure how to find the RMSE values because I don't know how to calculate the expected force values. Do you mind giving me a hint for this?     Thank you for your time and guidance
