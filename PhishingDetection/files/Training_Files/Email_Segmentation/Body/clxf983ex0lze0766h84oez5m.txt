Hope everyone had a great weekend!      Below are some updates for the upcoming week.    Solar Eclipse - There is a partial Solar Eclipse visible in North Carolina on Monday 4/8/24 starting around 1:50 pm and ending at 4:30 pm.  As a safety precaution for the children's eyes, we will not be having any PM outside time tomorrow.  Only the teachers in the Pre-Kindergarten 1 and Pre-kindergarten 2 classrooms will be taking their children outside for whom we have received the consent and release form for.  If we have not received the consent form for your child, we will not be able to take them outside.  Please see a separate email for PK1 and PK2 classrooms for tomorrow.    Week of the Young Child - Starting tomorrow is also the Week of the Young Child.  Below is a snapshot from the monthly newsletter of the daily fun things happening every day.  The classroom outdoor dance party will be happening for all classrooms during their AM outside time since there will be no PM outside time due to the Solar Eclipse.        Drop -Off Time - Friendly reminder our drop off time is in-between 7am to 10am for all full-time students.  For any half day students drop off time is at 8:30am.  If students are going to be past 10am please do let the administration know when we will be expecting our friend.    Pick-Up Time - Friendly reminder the school does close at 6pm.  Please pick up children by 6pm.  Our teachers have to sanitize the classrooms and clean-up before leaving for the day after the children have left their classrooms.    Please do let us know if there are any questions.    Have a great upcoming week
