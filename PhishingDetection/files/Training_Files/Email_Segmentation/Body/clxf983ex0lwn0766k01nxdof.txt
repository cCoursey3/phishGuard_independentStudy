My name is Chloe Coursey and I'm an intern with the SVIP program. I have one question regarding the orientation, does it end around noon or 5pm? I was reading the emails again and I understand that there is a guest speaker until about 11:30 but I'm unclear if orientation ends after that or if it continues until 5
