You do not know me because I am not in one of your classes but I'm reaching out to you on behalf of one of your current students Owen Gabriel Gromyko.    I'm honestly not sure if he is in your class but i know he is in ECE 401 001 and is expecting to take an exam tomorrow at 8:30. If he is not one of your students, I apologize and hope you can redirect me accordingly.    I'm sure this is unusual, but I want to ask if it would even be possible for him to take his exam at least later in the day. He is sick with what I believe is the flu. I've been tending to him for a bit and he is having HORRIBLE muscle fatigue, sweats, pains, etc. All classic signs of the flu. I came over after he took an exam this morning and he told me how bad he was doing and that he had no pain meds for his headache. As his partner I came to help him. I've been on his bedside changing a cool cloth every few minutes because his temperature keeps causing it to heat up so quickly. Unfortunately he doesn't have a thermometer where he lives so I can't even send formal proof of his state.     I told him to try and reach out earlier but he assured me there was no way his exam could be considered for a later time. However, considering the increased emphasis on student health physically and mentally, I was hoping you would consider, if nothing else, allowing him to take the exam at a different hour. As I'm sure you can conclude, being this sick and worrying about an 8:30 am exam is not ideal for the healing process.    I do apologize for any inconvenience this may cause or disrespect this may come across as on my part, but I want what is best for him and I'm confident an exam tomorrow is not that, much less at 8:30 in the morning.    I did not copy him on this email because I did not want his hopes to get up; plus I know him and he'd probably try to tough it out instead of risking offending a professor. I hope you will consider what I am suggesting
