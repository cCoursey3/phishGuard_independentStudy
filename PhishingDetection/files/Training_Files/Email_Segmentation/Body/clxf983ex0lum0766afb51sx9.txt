I hope this email finds you well. I wanted to inform you that I recently received an internship offer from a company I interviewed with last month, and I have accepted the offer. Unfortunately, this means that I will no longer be participating in the GCSP-REU program this summer. I apologize for any inconvenience this may cause.    However, I would still love to be a panelist for the GCSP-REU Welcome event on 5/20 if you are looking for someone to help. Please let me know if this is something you would like me to do, and I would be more than happy to assist in any way I can.    Wishing you luck running the program this summer
