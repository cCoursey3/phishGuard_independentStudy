Hayden was officially diagnosed with ADD yesterday and he started Concerta today. He has been struggling mightily and very burned out, but glad we figured out why. Apparently his therapist had suspicions years ago but she thinks the lack of academic rigor during the pandemic and then at his middle schools masked his issues. He was diagnosed by his psychiatrist but we are proceeding with full psychoeducational testing to be sure we aren't missing anything else. I will keep you updated.     Regarding midterms - I saw the schedule and I assume that kids with extended time go to a different location than kids without. Could you tell me where Hayden is supposed to go for his exams
