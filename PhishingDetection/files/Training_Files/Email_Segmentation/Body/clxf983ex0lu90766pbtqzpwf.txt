We wanted to send out a reminder that our office hours during the next few weeks will be 9:00am to 1:00pm, for emergency patients only.  This includes the week of April 6th.    Due to the importance of social distancing, the government has relaxed many of the rules regarding telehealth visits, and we can now treat some patients via telephone calls or 2-way video conferences during our office hours of 9:00am-1:00pm.  This includes Medicare, Maryland Medicaid, and many commercial insurances (BCBS, Aetna, Cigna, United, to name a few).  If you call our office the doctor on staff will determine if you are a candidate for a telehealth visit.  If so, under the new guidelines, we will bill your insurance for the visit and are waiving your copay.    We hope that you and your loved ones are healthy and safe.  We encourage you to self quarantine, and to follow all CDC guidelines in regard to hand-washing and disinfecting.    Once again, we look forward to the time when we can return to our normal operations
