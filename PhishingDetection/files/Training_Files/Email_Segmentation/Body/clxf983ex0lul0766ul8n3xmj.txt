You are both returning GCSP-REU Scholars this summer. Congrats on your acceptance and I look forward to working with you both again!   I am reaching out to request that you both are panelists for the GCSP-REU Welcome event on 5/20. I can provide you with the questions ahead of time (likely by Monday, 5/13). They will be regarding your research, current projects, REU experience, etc.   Please respond to this email to let me know if this is something you are willing to help with, I would truly appreciate it
