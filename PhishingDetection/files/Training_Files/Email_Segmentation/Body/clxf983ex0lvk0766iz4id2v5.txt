I hope you're doing well! I wanted to ask about the currency assignment. In your feedback, you noted that I didn't have returns for the other lags and didn't have a sensitivity analysis. In my excel, the returns are dependent on cells O3 and O4 which are the values of T and the , so when I adjust it, the returns, the sensitivity adjusted returns, the previous cell, and the Sharpe ratios adjust. I included the hard-coded table of the Sharpe ratios of the return based on the T value.  Would this not count as the sensitivity analysis and returns for other lags
