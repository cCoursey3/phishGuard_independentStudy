My name is Patrick Connolly, In 2019, My wife and I won the sum of Â£115 million Pounds on the EuroMillions jackpot. We are giving some of the money we won back to the community to help others. We have donated 25% of our winnings to Charities. And we also plan to give away another 25% to private individuals this year (2024). We have decided to donate US$37,500,000 to 50 random people. Your Reference Code is (REPUK/FPC2024/48765/BLN).    We sent this message out to 2800 random email addresses.
