I'm pleased to introduce the second Upper-Level Event of the summer -- the University Honors Program is heading back up to Virginia for a weekend in Williamsburg!    Screenshot 2024-05-19 at 1.27.52 PM.png    We'll have a Friday morning departure on June 7th and spend the afternoon exploring Colonial Williamsburg; we'll tour the Governor's Palace, Capitol, and Raleigh Tavern, and we'll visit trade shops, historic houses, and exhibition sites of Williamsburg's 18th century residents. Then we'll check into The Historic Powhatan, a residences resort with amenities including: indoor and outdoor pools, a sauna, tennis and racquetball courts, and a mini-golf course.    Saturday will be devoted to Water Country USA, Virginia's largest water park -- wave pools, lazy rivers, water coasters, live entertainment, and more! We'll call it quits when the park closes at 7pm and return to The Historic Powhatan for one more night before our departure on Sunday morning.     Including transportation, two nights at The Historic Powhatan, a half day at Colonial Williamsburg, and a full day at Water Country USA, this trip is available to UHP students at the low cost of $95.
