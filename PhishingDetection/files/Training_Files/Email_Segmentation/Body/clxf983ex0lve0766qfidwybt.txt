I've sent this message from your iCloud mail.     I want to inform you about a very bad situation for you. However, you can benefit from it, if you will act wisÐµly.     Have you heard of Pegasus? This is a spyware program that installs on computers and smartphones and allows hackers to monitor the activity of device owners. It provides access to your webcam, messengers, emails, call records, etc. It works well on Android, iOS, and Windows. I guess, you already figured out where I'm getting at.     It's been a few months since I installed it on all your dÐµviÑÐµs because you were not quite choosy about what links to click on the intÐµrnÐµt. During this period, I've learned about all aspects of your private life, but Ð¾nÐµ is of special significance to me.     I've recorded many videos of you jerking off to highly controversial ÑÐ¾rn videos. Given that the âquestionableâ genre is almost always the same, I can conclude that you have sick ÑÐµrvÐµrsiÐ¾n.     I doubt you'd want your friends, family and co-workers to know about it. However, I can do it in a few clicks.     Every number in your contact Iist will suddenly receive these vidÐµÐ¾s - on WhatsApp, on Telegram, on Instagram, on Facebook, on email - everywhere. It is going to be a tsunami that will sweep away everything in its path, and first of all, your fÐ¾rmÐµr life.     Don't think of yourself as an innocent victim. No one knows where your ÑÐµrvÐµrsiÐ¾n might lead in the future, so consider this a kind of deserved ÑunishmÐµnt to stop you.     I'm some kind of God who sees everything. However, don't panic. As we know, God is merciful and forgiving,  and so do I. But my mÐµrÑy is not free.     Transfer 1200 USD to my Litecoin (LTC) wallet: ltc1qha0shlkywgxqyylcxy82gqnf0efqtwcx65yku0     Once I receive confirmation of the transaction, I will ÑÐµrmanently delete all videos compromising you, uninstÐ°ll Pegasus from all of your devices, and disappear from your life. You can be sure - my benefit is only money. Otherwise, I wouldn't be writing to you, but destroy your life without a word in a second.     I'll be notified when you open my email, and from that moment you have exactly 48 hours to send the money. If cryptocurrencies are unchartered waters for you, don't worry, it's very simple. Just google âcrypto exchangeâ or "buy Litecoin" and then it will be no harder than buying some useless stuff on Amazon.     I strongly warn you against the following:  * Do not reply to this email. I've sent it from your iCloud mail.  * Do not contact the police. I have access to all your dÐµviÑÐµs, and as soon as I find out you ran to the cops, videos will be published.  * Don't try to reset or destroy your dÐµviÑÐµs. As I mentioned above: I'm monitoring all your activity, so you either agree to my terms or the vidÐµÐ¾s are Ñublished.     Also, don't forget that cryptocurrencies are anonymous, so it's impossible to identify me using the provided Ð°ddrÐµss.     Good luck, my perverted friend. I hope this is the last time we hear from each other.  And some friendly advice: from now on,
