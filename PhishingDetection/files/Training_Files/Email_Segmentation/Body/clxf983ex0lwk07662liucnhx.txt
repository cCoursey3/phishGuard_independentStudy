I've posted the notes and videos from our noon hw session (2.3 problems 4, 7, 6, and 2). Our 1:45pm problem session was, let's say, sparsely attended. I posted notes from the one question from 2.3 that was asked (#5) and then a trig substitution question and another example that someone asked about today. You can find all of this under the HW Hints section of our moodle page.    I was hoping to get some questions from 2.5 and 2.6, but I do understand that partial fractions can be tricky and that assignment is due tonight.     Hope you are all doing well. It was great to see the people who came to the sessions. Be sure to take the poll about when an optional recorded review session will be if you are interested in attending. It looks like it is mostly between Friday at 5pm and Sunday at 5pm
