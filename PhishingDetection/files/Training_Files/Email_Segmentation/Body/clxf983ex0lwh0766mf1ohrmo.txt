My name is Juan Padro, I recently accepted the position as a student trainee for USCIS in the Raleigh-Durham location. I wanted to see if there were any updates for the internship as I have not heard anything in some time and there does not seem to be any updates on USA-Jobs or USA Staffing. If it is just a matter of waiting I understand I was just curious about any updates
