Today is Endangered Species Day and you have an opportunity to protect, conserve, and restore Red Wolves in the wild in North Carolina. As one of the most endangered canids in the world, only found in the wild in North Carolina, what could be a greater purpose on this Endangered Species Day?        To get inspired, watch my brief video below to learn about Red Wolves and why Endangered Species Day is so important.    Endangered Species Day message from NCWF Red Wolf Education & Outreach Coordinator  With 17 known Red Wolves in the wild, they are threatened daily by roads and vehicles running throughout their habitat as well as by gunshot. NCWF is committed to addressing these risks.        When you drive on U.S. Highway 64 towards Alligator River National Wildlife Refuge, you will likely see electronic signage telling you to slow down because you're in Red Wolf territory. NCWF helped pay for these signs and is advocating for more fencing and wildlife crossings to prevent Red Wolf and other wildlife vehicle collisions.        You may also see signs on private property that read "Prey for the Pack". NCWF works with U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and private landowners on the Albemarle Peninsula to expand Red Wolf habitat by making habitat improvements that benefit Red Wolves, other wildlife, and the landowner through this cost-share program.        I work every day to raise awareness about Red Wolves by operating the Red Wolf Center in Columbia, North Carolina. However, my favorite way to share the Red Wolf story is taking people out on the Alligator River and Pocosin Lakes National Wildlife Refuges to experience Red Wolf habitat and all the wildlife that live there.        Come visit me at the Red Wolf Center and in the meantime, I invite you to donate to NCWF's Endangered Species May campaign to raise $10,000 by the end of May for Red Wolves, other listed wildlife, and those of greatest conservation need in North Carolina.        We are lucky here in North Carolina, to be home to the world's only wild Red Wolves. Let's not let them go extinct on our watch!        Thank you for caring and I hope to see you at the Red Wolf Center so
