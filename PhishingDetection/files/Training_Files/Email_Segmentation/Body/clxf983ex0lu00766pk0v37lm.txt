Thank you for letting me know.  Please let me know the earliest that you will be available so that I can accommodate you in either one of my labs or another TA's labs.   I will mark you as absent for now and Prof. Egler might change it to 'EX' once your lab exemption request has been accepted.    Today's lab involved filling out the TA evaluation at go.ncsu.edu/py206_ta_eval   I kindly request you to fill out the same.    Wishing you a speedy recovery
