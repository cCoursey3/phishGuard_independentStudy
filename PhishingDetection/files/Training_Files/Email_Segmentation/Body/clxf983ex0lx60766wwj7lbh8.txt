I know it has been stressful, but be assured, it will not be this complicated when you get here. The pandemic has had a way of causing problems in everything!  This summer's orientation (next month) will be a great time to get any questions answered and your schedule corrected, if needed.   I'm sure you will have a great time once we start in the Fall.    If you have any questions feel free to contact me anytime.  Good luck and have a wonderful summer vacation!!    Stay safe
