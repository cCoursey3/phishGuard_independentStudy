I just wanted to notify you that next week is spring break for the University.   Unless your instructor has said otherwise, no assignments are due during this time. Please use this time to take a breather or catch up on work if needed.       I also wanted to let all students know that during spring break (because of the Masters), the University pretty much shuts down, and the majority of offices are closed.     I want to let everyone know that I will not be available next week, but there will be rotating success staff that will be responding to emails at the AUO Success email. However, please know that because most offices on campus will be closed, any issues or adjustments concerning registration must occur after spring break.     During this pause, please remember to take care of yourself. You can't pour from an empty cup. Take a walk, watch a movie, eat some good food, and get some rest. You all work so hard and you have earned that break!
