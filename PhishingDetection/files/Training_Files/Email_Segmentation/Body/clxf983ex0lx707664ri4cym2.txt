I hope this email finds you well. I just wanted to give you a heads-up that our distributor will be dropping off the inventory for your system at your residence on March 28th. You do not have to be on-site nor do you have to receive it. This is just to keep you in the loop.    The distributor usually leaves the inventory in the driveway but as out of the way as possible. There will be 1-2 pallets of panels and a few boxes with the other equipment needed. All equipment is expected to take no more than 1 car space.    We will also have someone from 8MSolar come to your residence the day before the installation to count and verify all of the inventory delivered on-site.    Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns
