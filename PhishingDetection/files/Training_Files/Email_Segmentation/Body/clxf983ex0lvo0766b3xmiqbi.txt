I received an email today that there will be a celebration tomorrow night on Hillsborough Street starting at 7pm. In light of this, tomorrow evening's class has been cancelled. I want you all to be able to partake in the festivities if you so please, plus I'm scared of traffic and don't want my car stuck in Dan Allen overnight. This week was going to be Monday screening / Wednesday lecture anyway, so please watch the entirety of Treasure Planet before Wednesday's class. It's such a magical film and well worth viewing as an adult. I will lecture on Wednesday, and then we'll have our final discussion of the semester. If you need anything in the meantime, I'm an email away
