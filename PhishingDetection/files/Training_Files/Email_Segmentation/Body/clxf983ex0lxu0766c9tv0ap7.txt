I am Mr. Jones wife - Karen, I teach at Quince Orchard - and you might have heard that Mr. Jones is retiring in June.  I am hoping to compile messages for him, from the alum and even current students, so the alumni office helped me gather some emails.  I am obviously very proud of all that he has built at Good Counsel, and he is so proud of you and all that you have gone on to accomplish.  He would love to hear from you about any memories or feelings you have about the program and your time with him!  IF you would be willing to send him a message - feel free to write me a note, that I will compile into some kind of memory book.  I am also hoping that you can help spread the word - feel free to forward this message to any students you know from the STEM classes who might want to send a message and if you have any pictures I would love those as well
