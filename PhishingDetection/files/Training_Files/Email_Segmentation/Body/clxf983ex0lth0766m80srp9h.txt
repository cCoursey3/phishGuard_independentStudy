Thanks for your help on this. Here is what Mel and I are looking at for 2022:         May 2022 - received check for $34,535. Memo indicates it is for Q1 distribution and 2022 true up. By my calculations from what the Board voted to distribute and my ownership, roughly $13,500 should be Q1 distribution and $21,000 true up         August 2022 - received check for $17,504. Memo indicates it is for Q2 distribution and 2021 equalization. By my calculations almost all of this should be distribution.         So our total distribution from those two checks is roughly $31K. Adding the roughly $70K that is coming now that brings our total for 2022 to $101k in distributions. But the K1 says we had $138K in distributions on allocated earnings of $265K in earnings. This also doesn't make sense to me since we were supposed to be distributing 42.5% which for me should have been around  $112,625.
