I hope this email finds you well. I am working on problem 1.5 on the HW, but I have been struggling to debug the code that was provided. Please see the screenshot below for the error message.     I believe the error is caused by the difference in sample size between the three data sets, but I'm not sure how to make it work (I tried adding an apostrophe to transpose the data but that did not work). I would appreciate a hint to resolve this issue
