I tried calling the number listed below but the voicemail box was full so I was unable to leave a message.   I will address each of your concerns below, but If you prefer to call and discuss/review, my number is 919.513.3970.    1. I have attached a document that you can complete and return to disability@ncsu.edu that will add your mom to the list of people on your FERPA so we may discuss your eligibility status with her. When you completed the intake on May 7, you only listed Melvin Coursey beside Parent Name(s).  2. On May 19th, the DRO emailed you your Eligibility Summary and listed the required next steps for you to receive accommodations at NCSU. Please review your email for this important information. As stated in that email, I am available to meet if you have additional questions.  3. The DRO does not manage course waitlists, I suggest you keep checking to see if a space opens up in the section you are hoping to enroll in or perhaps try to rearrange a few other courses if taking Calculus I is a priority. It may also be helpful to connect with your Academic Advisor to discuss other possible options.  4. If you would like to change your preferred email at NCSU, click here for instructions.
