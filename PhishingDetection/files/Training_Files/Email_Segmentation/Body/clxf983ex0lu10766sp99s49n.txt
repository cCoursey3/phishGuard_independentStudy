I am so so sorry for the late email and I totally understand if you cannot help me with this problem.    So recently, my parents bought a house in the Raleigh area (they currently live in DC) and went to settlement n move in today which I helped with. However, since it is a new house there is no wifi set up, but the wifi should be set up later today (the 28th) as a router and modem is coming  in the mail. i recognize i had the capabilities to finish my webassign assignments before now and I could have emailed earlier than this but with all the move in chaos I honestly forgot to email you about this and lost track of time as I had hopes to finish my syllabus quiz prelab and postlab before now. I am going to request an extension via webassign although I am not sure if i can do that now that the due time has passed. Regardless, I am very sorry for the late notice and this won't happen again. I am normally very on top of my work and I honestly don't know what happened here. I apologize for this inconvenience but still hope you will grant me an extension (although I understand if you deny the request).
