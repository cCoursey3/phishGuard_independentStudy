Today we discovered that most of our incoming phone lines are not working, including our pool phone line. We have contacted our phone company, and they will be out tomorrow, Saturday, May 25, 2024.    Unfortunately, we can not open the pool today, as the phone pool is not working. We are hopeful that after the visit from the phone company tomorrow, we will be able to open the pool. Please watch for email updates throughout the weekend.    Thank you for your patience while our office phones are experiencing issues. If you need to reach us, our email is working. Our email address is maa900waterford@maac.com
