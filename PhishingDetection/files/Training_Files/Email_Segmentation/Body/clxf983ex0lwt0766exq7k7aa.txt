We're delighted you're here and looking forward to a fantastic Forum this semester. As you hopefully are aware, we have planned what we believe is going to be a pretty wowtastic semester with Main Forum (the Monday and Tuesday Forums) primarily in person, with occasional Zoom sessions for breakouts and guests that it was impractical to bring to campus. We have decided to hold this week's Forum Business Meetings online for a couple of reasons. Using synchronous Zoom meetings will allow us to better reach all students this week, as we've heard from a number of students with one-time conflicts due to program orientations this afternoon. Accordingly, we will record today's session and it will be posted online by tomorrow morning for anyone unable to attend today or tomorrow's live, synchronous Forum Business Meeting. We will email additional details and instructions about where to find the recording when it goes live.         We will have the chat live today and tomorrow during the webinar, so feel free to start greeting one another (and us!) when you arrive. You'll be able to ask questions through the chat.         Make sure you register ahead of time for the session you plan to attend.
