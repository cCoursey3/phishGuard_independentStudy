Your accommodations have been communicated to me by the DRO. You may record the audio lectures any way you would like and the lectures are also recorded.     For your testing related accommodations, we can work together come test time to find what works best for you and I have no problem with you testing at a DRO site if that is what gives you the best testing environment
