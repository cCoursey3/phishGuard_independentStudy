I hope you are having a good day. A few parents have asked about the number of cups to bring in each day. Per sanitation we ask parents to bring in three cups per day for their child. Sanitation requires us to use a new cup for each use and does not allow us to reuse cups throughout the day. Each cup should be labeled with your child's first and last name and the date.  If you have any questions, please let us know
