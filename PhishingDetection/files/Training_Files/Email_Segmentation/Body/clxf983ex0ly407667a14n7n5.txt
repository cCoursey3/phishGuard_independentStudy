This email serves as a heads-up regarding the upcoming electrical panel upgrade scheduled for Building 12 on June 6 and expected to be completed by August 12.    The current electrical panel has reached the end of its lifespan and requires an upgrade to ensure continued safe and reliable power supply for the building.     What to Expect:    There will be brief power outages during the upgrade process. A detailed schedule of these outages will be circulated closer to the start date.  The work will primarily take place in the designated electrical room and may cause minimal noise disruption.  For safety reasons, access to the electrical room will be restricted during the upgrade.  Preparation:    We encourage you to save any unsaved work and shut down electronic equipment before the scheduled power outages.  If you have any critical equipment that cannot tolerate power interruptions, please contact the Facilities Department at [Phone Number or Email Address] to discuss alternative arrangements.  We appreciate your understanding and cooperation as we complete this necessary upgrade.    Should you have any questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to contact the Facilities Department
