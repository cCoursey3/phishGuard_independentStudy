This is the Children's Message I planned out with Ian. Tell me if you have any changes or just flat out don't like it. Basically we will be comparing David and Goliath to  the Apostles. If you are already confused, just read the attachment below, hopefully it will explain what I mean better than I can right now. Also, I have a concussion and am still trying to figure out if I can participate in the Children's Message. I think I will be able to, but just in case you should figure out if you want to do something else if I am not there. Also, I totally do not care if you don't want to do this. Please don't feel obliged to say yes (or no). Finally, feel free to respond to me over text ð
