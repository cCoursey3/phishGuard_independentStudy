I'm reaching out in regards to my final exam. I attempted to set an appointment with the DRO office, but unfortunately they are fully booked for the day of the final exam. I was wondering how we could schedule my final exam to fit both of our schedules. My accomodations include Alternate testing sheets (not scantron/computer generated sheets), 50% extended time, and reduced-distraction settings. I'm sorry for any inconvenience this may cause
