I'd like to extend a huge thank you to every single one of you for your engagement with Upper-Level Events this spring semester. It has truly been a pleasure!    Regardless of graduation status, I would very much appreciate you all taking a few minutes to complete a survey regarding your experience with Upper-Level Events this previous semester. Responses from these forms will help build the case for continuing these events and setting aside an appropriate budget for them. They also (of course) help us understand what can be done better, what you absolutely loved, and what we need more of. Your feedback here is greatly valued.    If you attended any standard Upper-Level Events, please fill out this survey.    If you attended any of the Upper-Level Trips (Ski Trip, Richmond, or Nashville), please fill out this survey.    Thank you all so much for your time! I hope to see you soon :
