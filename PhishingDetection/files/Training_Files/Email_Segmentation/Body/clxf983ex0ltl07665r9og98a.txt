I'm so sorry - the whole reason we've been trying to get him in sooner was so that if he needs medication we could try it over Christmas break rather than while he is in school. If we have to wait until after break for the follow up it would be better to just stick with the original dates of Dec 20 and 21. Are those still free? If not, do you have an earlier follow up slot? That way Hayden could possibly do his follow up over xmas break and not miss school for that.     If Dec 20 and 21 are no longer available could you just give me a call? That will probably be easiest given how complicated this is.
