This letter is a courteous reminder that as of January 15, 2024, we have not received your payment of membership dues for the current 2024 year. We certainly understand that oversights happen with all the other day to day priorities placed on us as individuals. As a valued member of the Nanticoke Indian Association, âNIA,â we are providing you this gentle reminder.         Through the Nanticoke Indian Association and its members and despite the coronavirus pandemic, we are continuing our work to improve our Tribal awareness, our Tribal community, education opportunities, job training, and employment opportunities along with providing other valuable resources that work to improve the quality of life for our members and the tribe.         The Nanticoke Indian Association Dues assist us in many ways including funding family-oriented activities, cultural sharing, and community events that will resume as soon as it is safe for our members, volunteers, and staff.  These events raise money to support our association, historic museum, student scholarships, and our neighboring tribal community.          According to the following By-Laws adopted on June 7, 2005 and revised on August 5, 2014:         Annual Dues shall be assessed to each Regular and Associate Member in the amount of TEN DOLLARS ($10.00), due on January 1st of each year.   Any member unable to pay his/her dues by January 15th of the current year shall receive a written notice that his/her Membership dues are past due.    If dues are not paid by February 28th of the current year, the Member will be removed from the membership rolls.  Should you be dropped from the membership rolls because of non-payment of dues, reinstatement requires that you complete and submit all paperwork, genealogies, fees, etc.   Current Reinstatement fee is $60.00 - this includes fees and dues.  If the applicant is below the age of 18 years, the reinstatement fee is $35.00 (fees and dues).        We certainly would not want to lose you as a valued member due to a mere oversight on your behalf.  We would like you to know we truly appreciate you as a member and welcome your continued support in the upcoming year.  Also, please know that you can renew for multiple years if this is more convenient for you.         If you feel you have received this notice in error, please contact the NIA office immediately, so we can update our records.
