Welcome to the team!  We are so excited for you to join us this summer! I wanted to begin walking you through the onboarding process. I just initiated a background check and drug screening via email. It is important to get this done as soon as possible.    Please see the details below regarding a background check and drug screening. If you have any questions at all, please don't hesitate to reach out.    You should have received an email regarding the following:    Background Check  Drug Screening  You will need to fill out the personal information required for Sterling to complete the background check. The entire process should be completed in no more than 5 days. The first 48 hours should be dedicated to ensuring the background check portion is completed by you. Please send me an email once you have completed the background check portion, as this will prompt us to launch out the drug screening portion of your clearance. This will permit you 72 hours to take the drug screening test. Once you enter your preferred address, this will automatically generate the closest drug screening locations to your home address. Please ensure the address you utilize is the address you physically reside in (even if just currently), so that you can get the nearest location. A chain of custody form will then be given to you to take to the laboratory, along with proper identification.    Please ensure you notify us if the following occurs:    You cannot fill out the background check within the given 48 hours.  You cannot take the exam within the given 72 hours (either for personal reasons or unable to secure an appointment). Timely completion of the drug screening should be ensured, as we do expect a week or two turnaround time frames to have results provided back to us.  If you did not receive this email, please let me know AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.    Please let me know if you have any questions
