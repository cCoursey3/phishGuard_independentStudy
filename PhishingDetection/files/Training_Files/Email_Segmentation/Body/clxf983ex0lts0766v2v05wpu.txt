I'd like to offer a opportunity to participate the development of an open source library named SEEDGuard.AI (https://seedguard.ai/).    You can consider this as your side project (for both short and long term) and work with us for fun and also impact the future of code intelligence.    For more details, please visit the website and also join us via Discord. We will provide more resources once you join in
