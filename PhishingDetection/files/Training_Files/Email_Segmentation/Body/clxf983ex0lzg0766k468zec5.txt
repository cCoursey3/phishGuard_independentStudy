I hope you are doing well.    The final inspection for your solar installation is scheduled for Thursday (04-04-2024). We will get the inspection window on the day of the inspection.    The project coordinator Walter Schilling can be reached at (919) 890-0064.    The inspector will need internal access to the home, so on the day of the inspection, someone must be present at home.    Let me know if you have any questions
