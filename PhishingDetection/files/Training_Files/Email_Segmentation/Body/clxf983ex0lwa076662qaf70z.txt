I often get questions about the prominent bison in NCWF's logo. It was introduced in 1969 to commemorate the organization's 25th anniversary. It symbolizes NCWF's vision and strengths.        The National Bison Legacy Act, passed by Congress in April 2016, made the bison a U.S. symbol of resilience, unity, and healthy landscapes and communities.        Bison, unlike cattle, do not turn their backs to storms and bad weather, but face directly into the rain and winds. Like the bison, NCWF is agile, strong, dedicated to the cause, and faces a challenge full on.        Maybe one day the bison will be reintroduced in the wild in North Carolina too.        Other extinct species that once called North Carolina home, include the Carolina parakeet, passenger pigeon, and Bachman's warbler.        Though these species are some of the few to go fully extinct since colonization, they are not alone in facing threats of extinction, and they are certainly not the only ones to experience significant population declines at the hands of market hunting, habitat loss, and resource scarcity.        Tomorrow is Endangered Species Day and NCWF is raising awareness about endangered, threatened, and species of greatest conservation need in order to prevent further losses. You can make a difference right now by doing two things:        Read more about extinct wildlife in North Carolina  Donate to NCWF's Endangered Species May campaign to raise $10,000 by the end of May to support NCWF's work to protect, conserve, and restore listed species and those of greatest conservation need.      Losing wildlife affects us all. Together, we can make a difference
